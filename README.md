# Text adventure project template for Defold

Ever thought to create something "Twine-looking" but with more readable script and more coding possibilities?

Now you can make it with [Defold](https://defold.com) and [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) !

This template contains [The Intercept](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/theintercept/) sample game.	It's ink script was slightly modified to demonstrate use of UI widgets (similar to Twine's) and some [defold-ink](https://github.com/abadonna/defold-ink) features.

Happy Defolding!
